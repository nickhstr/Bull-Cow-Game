# Bulls and Cows
A simple take on the game "Bulls and Cows" using C++.

## Farm Animals and C++
Here's how the game works:
* Some super sweet ASCII art greets the player
* The player is given the length of an isogram and tasked with guessing the word
* Depending on the word's length, the player has a number of tries to guess
* Guesses are validated upon submission, with invalid guesses not counting against the number of tries
* Win or lose, the player can choose to play again or quit
